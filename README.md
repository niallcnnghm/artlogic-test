# artlogic-test

Thanks for reading my test. I wanted to add the changes I would have done with a bit more time. I usually use a CSS preprocessor like SASS - I find the nested syntax easier to read and being able to add variables would mean making less media queries.

If I could have used an image, I would have made the arrow function an image so that I could set a rotate(180deg) property to indicate the toggle to be more noticeable.

I would have also used a lower quality image for the background. A 5.5MB image is slow to load on browsers and I don't believe an image of that size is neccesarily worthwhile.
